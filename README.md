The study addresses the challenges of manually counting red blood cells (RBCs) and determining blood types, which are time-consuming and prone to error. 
It proposes an automated image processing system to enhance accuracy and efficiency in blood type analysis.
The system utilizes optical properties of blood antigens and the Rhesus factor to classify blood types unobtrusively.
By analyzing fingertip images from a database, the framework aims to provide a rapid and reliable method for blood typing, 
reducing the risk of errors in blood transfusions and improving overall diagnostic processes in hematology.

Division and tallying of platelets are taken into consideration as a huge enhance that 
assists with setting apart highlightsto research a fewunique ailments. The guide tallying 
of RBCs in minuscule pics is an amazingly dreary, tedious and rancid base procedure. 
Programmed research will allow haematologist professionals to carry out faster and 
greater precisely. Examination of blood type performs an vital amassing withinside 
there storative discipline for any treatment. False transfusion of blood willset offseveral 
issues. This framework offers easy and short strategies for distinguishing evidence of 
blood classifications and Rhesus element none obtrusively. Our shape is attempted on 
some authentic informational collections of several character pics of human finger-tip 
pics. Blood type is grouped depending on the nearness and non appearance of sure 
natural materials known as antibodies and depending on the nearness or non attendance 
ofreceived antigenic protein materials at the surfaces ofthe erythrocytes with inside the 
body. Along those strains via way of means of making use of the optical houses of the 
antigens and the rhesus calculate gift the blood, the blood gatherings may be ordered
